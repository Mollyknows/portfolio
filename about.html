        <h2>Hi there!</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Molly Calhoun, and I'm on a jounrey to learn more about
          software engineering, computer science, and game development! I'm
          currently in my second semester of the Kennesaw State University
          Master's of Software Engineering (a bit of a mouthfull, I know!) and
          I'm hoping to focus primarily on game development and web service
          engineering.
        </p>

          Curently I'm an intern at a tech startup called Payroll Integrations,
          where we're developing an API that helps employers automate the
          process of connecting loan deductions and 401k contributions from
          payroll. It's definitely been an eye-opening expereince, and I feel
          like I've learned so much, even though I just started last year with
          almost no coding knowledge.
        </p>
        <br />

          When I'm not working or doing schoolwork, I enjoy reading, playing
          video games, and making jewelry! I also have two cats, Spaceface and
          Spot, who you can see below. If you're interested in reaching out with
          a professional query, please contact me at the email listed on my
          contact page. Thank you for visiting my site, and I hope you enjoy
          your stay!
