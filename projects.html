      <h3>Details</h3>
      <p>
        This project was an assignment for my game development class in my
        master's program. In it we were challenged with following
        <a
          href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html"
          >this tutorial</a
        >
        to develop our first 2D game. After we completed the tutorial we had to
        make additional adjustments to the game like adding new timers, enemy
        types, and collectible items. I found this to be a fascinating
        introduction to game development, and felt like the project provided me
        with a nice mixture of guidance and self teaching opportunities. by the
        end of the project I felt like I'd had that "Aha!" moment where
        everything started to click together. This was our first class project,
        and I'm eagerly looking forward to building on the knowledge I gained
        here when we make more games in the future.

          heirarchy system
        </li>
        <li>
          Core functionalities of the Godot development environment (animation,

      </ul>
      <h3>Tools Used</h3>
      <ul>
